        Tattoo's are looked down upon by most of society. Not by me though, to me it an art.
        A piece of artwork created by an artist who was extremely passioned about it that convinced
        him or her to permanently have it on their bodies. It also shows who someone is and their
        interest. My tattoos werre all drawn from scratch and took about 6 months minimum to actually
        create.
