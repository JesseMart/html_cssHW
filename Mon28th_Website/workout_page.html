        Working out has been a must for my life ever since joining the Marine Corp. They taught me the importance of staying fit and working to break my limits. Most would go to the gym and stop going after the soreness hits or 
        when it gets harder to wake up for training. Me? I would WANT to hit the gym because if I don't i'll get
        down in the feelings and feel weak for not going. The gym would always be a second home to me.
