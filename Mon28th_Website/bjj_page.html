    <p>
        Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ for short) has been part of my life<br> for about 3 years now.
        Its been a ride to train and learn<br>from people from many backgrounds of fighting
        and cultures.<br> A family is formed once you start at a gym, it takes time<br> but its
        guaranteed. This part of my life has brought pain from torn muslces to broken ribs and 
        dislocated fingers, however its still worth it being able to get stronger as time
        progresses.
