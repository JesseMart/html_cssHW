        Motorcycles are another huge passion of mine that holds a special place
        in my heart. As a kid I always wanted one and promised myself I'll get to
        the point of owning one. At 20 years of age I bought my first Harley Davidson,
        which I ended up crashing on the highway. I bought my second one in 2018 and
        it was my dream biek, the V-ROD, a muscle motrocycle. Even though riding carries 
        its danger, it doesnt beat the feeling of riding down an empty road with nice
        weather and smooth roads.
