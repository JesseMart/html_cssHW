        I've played video games since I was a little child. My first system was a Gameboy back 
        when there was no backlight for the screen so you had to use the light poles from 
        the street in order to see. My actual first console was PlayStation 2 and I sticked 
        with Sony consoles  ever since. My favorite video game franchise of all time is 
        Assassin's Creed.
